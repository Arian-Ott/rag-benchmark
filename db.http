# ======= Important message ========
#
# To whom I may concern,
#
# Recently (actually yesterday) I saw a video on Instagram where someone
# makes fun about people who push API keys on a Git repository. They
# claim that every developer at least once in their life does this.
#
# Until today,this never happened to me. When this happens, you usually
# delete the reopsitory and start over again. However, I do not have enough
# time and energy to start all over again.
#
# Since this repo will eventually become open-source and therefore my commit
# history as well, I decided NOT to delete this repository. Instead I added
# all `*.http` files to my  `.gitignore` and `.dockerignore` files.
#
# Furthermore I created a new API key to prevent potential abuse. This is
# only possible, because all backend (except of Azure OpenAI) is entirely
# hosted by me.
#
# The key above is now invalidated and replaced with a new one.
# Yes, I won't delete this repo cause I don't have time to push everything
# again lol.
#
# Thank you for your understanding.
#
# Faithfully yours,
# Arian Ott
